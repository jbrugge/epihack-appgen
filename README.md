Epihack 2015 app generator
=============================

This is a Node server setup to help prototype a mobile app generator for participatory surveillance at mass gatherings. See http://epihack.org/2015/06/17/epihack-rio-2015/.

### Installation


To install, download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for your platform, then download and install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/).

Once Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed, you can download the latest release of this GitHub repo, and unzip it. `cd` into the unzipped folder and run:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

The username for vagrant is `vagrant` and the password is `vagrant`. 

This will download and install the image, and then go through the dependencies and install them one by one. `vagrant ssh` will connect you to the image and give you a bash prompt. Once everything completes, you'll have a working box to build your apps on Android.
